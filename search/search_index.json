His pioneering work on the science of ontology led to the establishment of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is the most commonly adopted top-level ontology development framework. In 2021, BFO was approved as an ISO standard top-level ontology (in ISO/IEC:21838-2). This makes it the first example of a piece of philosophy that has been elevated to the level of an international standard. His work led also to the formation of the OBO (Open Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry, a suite of interoperable ontology modules designed to support information-driven research in biology and biomedicine. The methodology underlying BFO and the OBO Foundry is today being applied in a range of different domains, including military intelligence, industrial engineering and quantum physics.
