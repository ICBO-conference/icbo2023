## Entry Visas to Brazil
Brazil adopts a policy of reciprocity regarding visas. This means that nationals of countries that require visas for Brazilian citizens will need a visa to travel to Brazil. According to the Brazilian law, Brazil must agree, on a reciprocal basis, to offer visa waiver to nationals of another country, except for the hypotheses established in the Decree 9.731 / 2019. Brazil has signed visa exemption agreements with about 90 countries.
