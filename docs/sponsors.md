# ICBO Sponsors

Sponsorships from companies and organizations help to defray some of our costs and enable us to offer registration fee discounts for conference participants.

## Sponsorship
We gratefully accept sponsorships from private companies and organizations. We acknowledge our sponsors before, during and after the event in multiple ways:

* We list our sponsors on the ICBO and ONTOBRAS websites.
* Sponsors are thanked and named in the opening/closing slides during the meeting.
* The sponsors are thanked in selected emails to our mailing list, tweets and blog posts (with your logo) that go out before, during and after the event.
