## COVID Statement and Duty of Care
The International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO) 2023 is committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for all participants. We are working with the University of Brasília (UnB) on implementing preventive measures to reduce the potential spread of the COVID-19 virus. Our preventive measures and policies are guided by the requirements and recommendations of the Brasil [Ministry of Health](https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/coronavirus/publicacoes-tecnicas/guias-e-planos/guia-de-vigilancia-epidemiologica-covid-19/view), [National Health Surveillance Agency - Anvisa](https://www.gov.br/anvisa/pt-br/assuntos/paf/coronavirus) and others federal, state and local health authorities, as well as the health and safety requirements for [UnB events](http://www.dac.unb.br/images/DASU/PANDEMIA/GUIAS/Guia_Biosseguranca_Final_Justificado.pdf). These requirements change frequently; up-to-date requirements will be communicated to registered ICBO 2023 attendees shortly before the meeting. Based on past experience, these U-M, local, state and federal requirements may include policies regarding vaccination, negative COVID-19 tests, social distancing and/or masking. 

Note that international travelers should additionally monitor the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs requirements](www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/embaixada-bucareste/covid-19-viagem-ao-brasil-traveling-to-brazil/covid-19-traveling-to-brazil) regarding entry into the Brasil and also by [ANVISA Rules](https://www.gov.br/anvisa/pt-br/english/updates/covid-19-new-rules-for-entering-brazil).

The responsibility for a safe and healthy event environment is shared by every participant. All ICBO 2023 Meeting participants are expected to adhere to and abide by health and safety precautions implemented for the meeting as well as other government and facility regulations. As part of your Duty of Care responsibilities, you should not attend the ICBO 2023 Meeting if you:
