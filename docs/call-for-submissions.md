<br><br>
There is also an Overleaf Template available here: [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk)    

## Poster preparation guideline
- Posters session will be just in-person.
- Porters should be built in A0 paper size, vertically (portrait) orientation, paper or fabric material.
- We will provide a template with details soon.

<!-- The poster boards are self-standing with legs, four feet wide by three feet high (landscape). The fabric is grey on one sidle and black on the other. Light-weight posters, photos, and couments can be affixed to the displays using thumbtacks.
Therefore, the maximum size of your poster will be 4’ wide by 3’ high.  -->
