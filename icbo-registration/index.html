<p>The International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO) 2023 is committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for all participants. We are working with the University of Brasília (UnB) on implementing preventive measures to reduce the potential spread of the COVID-19 virus. Our preventive measures and policies are guided by the requirements and recommendations of the Brasil <a href="https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/coronavirus/publicacoes-tecnicas/guias-e-planos/guia-de-vigilancia-epidemiologica-covid-19/view">Ministry of Health</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.br/anvisa/pt-br/assuntos/paf/coronavirus">National Health Surveillance Agency - Anvisa</a> and others federal, state and local health authorities, as well as the health and safety requirements for <a href="http://www.dac.unb.br/images/DASU/PANDEMIA/GUIAS/Guia_Biosseguranca_Final_Justificado.pdf">UnB events</a>. These requirements change frequently; up-to-date requirements will be communicated to registered ICBO 2023 attendees shortly before the meeting. Based on past experience, these U-M, local, state and federal requirements may include policies regarding vaccination, negative COVID-19 tests, social distancing and/or masking. </p>
<p>Note that international travelers should additionally monitor the <a href="ww.gov.br/mre/pt-br/embaixada-bucareste/covid-19-viagem-ao-brasil-traveling-to-brazil/covid-19-traveling-to-brazil">Ministry of Foreign Affairs requirements</a> regarding entry into the Brasil and also by <a href="https://www.gov.br/anvisa/pt-br/english/updates/covid-19-new-rules-for-entering-brazil">ANVISA Rules</a>.</p>
